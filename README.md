# Learning-from-supervised-unsupervised-images-using-GANs
Biomedical application of computer vision principles

With recent progress in graphics, it has become more
tractable to train models on synthetic images, potentially
avoiding the need for expensive annotations. However,
learning from synthetic images may not achieve the
desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and
real image distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose
Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where
the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of
a simulatorâ€™s output using unlabeled real data, while
preserving the annotation information from the simulator.
We develop a method for S+U learning that uses
an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs
instead of random vectors.
